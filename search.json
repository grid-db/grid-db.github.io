    "text": "From protecting biodiversity to ensuring the safety of drinking water, the biochemical makeup of rivers and streams around the United States is critical for human and environmental welfare. Studies have found that human activity and urbanization are driving salinization (increased salt content) of freshwater sources across the country. In excess, salinity can make water undrinkable, increase the cost of treating water, and harm freshwater fish and wildlife.\nAlong with the rise in salinity has also been an increase in alkalinity over time, and past research suggests that salinization may enhance alkalinization. But unlike excess salinity, alkalinization can have a positive impact on the environment due to its ability to neutralize water acidity and absorb carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere—a key component to combating climate change. Understanding the processes at play that affect salinity and alkalinity have important environmental and health implications.\nA team of researchers from Syracuse University and Texas A&M University have applied a machine learning model to explore where and to what extent human activities are contributing to the hydrogeochemical changes, such as increases in salinity and alkalinity in U.S. rivers.\nThe group used data from 226 river monitoring sites across the U.S. and built two machine-learning models to predict monthly salinity and alkalinity levels at each site. These sites were selected because long-term continuous water quality measurements have been recorded for at least 30 years.\nFrom urban to rural settings, the model explored a diverse range of watersheds, which are areas where all flowing surface water converges to a single point, such as a river or lake. It evaluated 32 watershed factors ranging from hydrology, climate, geology, soil chemistry, land use and land cover to pinpoint the factors contributing to rising salinity and alkalinity. The team’s models determined human activities as major contributors to the salinity of U.S. rivers, while rising alkalinity was mainly attributed more to natural processes than human activities.\nThe team, which included Syracuse University researchers Tao Wen, assistant professor in the College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES), Beibei E, a graduate student in EES, Charles T. Driscoll, University Professor of Environmental Systems and Distinguished Professor in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and Texas A&M assistant professor Shuang Zhang, recently had their findings published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.\n\nWhat’s Driving Salinization and Alkalinization?\nThe results from the group’s sodium prediction model, which detected human activities such as the application of road salt as major contributions to the salinity of U.S. rivers, were consistent with previous studies. This model specifically revealed population density and impervious surface percentage (artificial surfaces such as roads) as the two most important contributors to higher salt content in U.S. rivers.\nAccording to Wen, the accuracy of the salinity model provided an important proof of concept for the research team.\n“In regard to causes of salinity in rivers, the results from our machine learning model matched those of previous studies which focused on field observation, lab work and statistical analysis,” says Wen. “This proved that our approach was working.”\nWith the salinity results confirming the accuracy of the team’s model, they then turned their attention to alkalinity. Their model identified natural processes as predominantly contributing to variation in river alkalinity, a contrast to previous research that identified human activities as the main contributor to alkalinization (Kaushal et al., 2018). They found that local climatic and hydrogeological conditions including runoff, sediment, soil pH and moisture, were features most affecting river alkalinity.\n\n\nCritical to the Carbon Cycle\nTheir findings have important environmental and climate implications as alkalinity in rivers forms a vital link in the carbon cycle. Consider the movement of carbon during a rainstorm. When it rains, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with water to form carbonic acid. When the carbonic acid reaches the ground and comes into contact with certain rocks, it triggers a chemical reaction that extracts gaseous carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transports it to the ocean via land water systems like lakes and rivers.\nKnown as rock weathering, this natural process continuously erodes away rocks and sequesters atmospheric CO2 over millions of years. It is also a key regulator of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.\n“Rock weathering is the primary source of alkalinity in natural waters and is one of the main ways to bring down carbon dioxide in air,” says Wen. Think of it as a feedback loop: when there is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, temperatures increase leading to enhanced rock weathering. With more rock being dissolved into watersheds due to enhanced rock weathering, alkalinity rises and in turn, brings down carbon dioxide.\n“Alkalinity is a critical component of the carbon cycle,” says Wen. “While we found that natural processes are the primary drivers of alkalinization, these natural factors can still be changed by humans. We can alter the alkalinity level in rivers by changing the natural parameters, so we need to invest more to restore the natural conditions of watersheds and tackle global warming and climate changes to deal with alkalinization in U.S. rivers.”\nThe results from the team’s study can help inform future research about enhanced rock weathering efforts—where rocks are ground up and spread across fields. By distributing rock dust across large areas, it increases the amount of contact between rain and rock, which enhances carbon removal from the atmosphere. Wen says the team’s model can help answer questions about the evolution of natural conditions in different regions—an important step needed to implement enhanced rock weathering more effectively."

Data that will be input into the Shale Network database will generally be stored first as Excel files. We assemble these files for data entry into the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS) for permanent publication online and for access through HydroClient and HydroShare.\nThe Shale Network database team will accept data and organize it and place it online so that citizens and researchers can understand whether development of shale gas is affecting water quality and quantity. The data are housed in a permanent database that is funded for permanent access online by the National Science Foundation. Data in Shale Network can be accessed along with all other data published online, including data from EPA, USGS, and academic researchers. Assessment of the quality of data is very difficult, regardless of whether data is collected by scientists or volunteers. Our overall philosophy will be to accept data and place it online for the community of citizens and researchers to evaluate, as long as the data provider has some level of quality assurance and control. Levels of data quality will be indicated within the database as a metadata field. All data in the database will not have the same data quality. However, finding data will be much easier: the researcher can then spend resources assessing data quality rather than finding data.\nQuality assurance refers to measures taken to ensure data meets data quality standards; quality control means the actions implemented to achieve quality. Data quality objectives include that the data must be credible and of sufficient value for timely response to problems. We accept data from volunteers who have received training from service providers in the state of PA such as ALLARM. This training generally consists of close examination of the monitoring manuals, laboratory training on equipment, and field training including chemical monitoring, flow measurement, and visual assessment. Meters for measurement of conductivity are calibrated with standard solutions before each use and are stored according to manufacturer specifications between use. Volunteers generally work with ALLARM to pass a split sample quality control test annually. Specifically, monitors generally use meters to test waters and then collect an extra set of water samples to send to the ALLARM lab. At the lab, the water is tested using the monitors’ equipment as well as laboratory equipment and results are compared to volunteer data. If precision is acceptable, volunteers have passed quality control and can continue monitoring to provide data. If precision is not acceptable (outside limits), ALLARM re-trains volunteers. All methods are documented. ALLARM is responsible for QC/QA with volunteer groups as appropriate. Some ALLARM groups collect samples and send them to commercial laboratories as well.",

    "text": "Publishing and Accessing Data with CUAHSI HIS\nThe CUAHSI HIS (Hydrologic Information System) is designed to manage and to publish data collected at fixed points, such as wells and surface water sampling stations. We are using this service because we have data from various sources that we want to make accessible online – this is called publishing the data – in a standard way so that everyone can access and use it. CUAHSI hosts a HydroServer and uses it to host the Shale Network database. CUAHSI already interacts heavily with the USGS, and USGS data are already a part of the CUAHSI HIS, or can be “ingested” easily. CUAHSI has also worked with EPA so that EPA data are available using HydroClient, and has worked with several state agencies around the country to format the state data into the HIS. Agencies that are interested in having their data available in HydroClient are encouraged to contact CUAHSI directly or discuss the issue with members of Shale Network.\nA Hydroserver is essentially a Windows XP computer running HIS software designed for data publication. Because it does not require a commercial license we are using HydroServer Lite. HydroLite uses the Observations Data Model for data storage and a WaterOneFlow web service for data publication.\nFor some datasets that we are given from data providers, we use the application ODM Data Loader (ODMDL) to load data files into an ODM database. This method is appropriate for data that are the result of a project or study that has been completed and will not need periodic updating. For data that are being continuously updated (i.e., data streaming from sensors in the field) we use the ODM Streaming Data Loader (also free software). The concept behind ODMDL is that it accepts input data in table format (Excel, CSV, or tab- separated), and it is designed to enable the loading of data into ODM tables either one at a time or as bulk data loading from a single file into multiple tables all at once. Once data are loaded into an ODM database, we can look at the data using the application ODM Tools. ODM Tools provide query and visualization capabilities. If the data look good, we can then publish the data with a WaterOne Flow web service. This service essentially hooks directly into an ODM database to publish data from that database. When data are published this way, it results in a standard output format called WaterML.\nThe next step after publishing is to register our WaterOneFlow web service. Registering is necessary in order for people to access our data (data discovery). To do this, HIS Central is a website maintained by the CUAHSI HIS team where we register our WaterOneFlow web service. Our service will then be discoverable along with dozens of other web services registered with the system (including services for the USGS NWIS and the EPA STORET datasets). HIS Central is the largest single catalog of the nation’s water data. HIS Central includes the free and open source desktop application, Hydrodesktop. Hydrodesktop allows users to search for data across all registered data sources at once.",

The GRID database will fill this gap by integrating high-resolution, multi-disciplinary data on global rivers and watersheds, enabling scientists and decision-makers to develop effective solutions for water management, disaster mitigation, and environmental preservation.\nHowever, the GRID project is much more than just a database—it is an integrated system comprising a database, a software ecosystem, and a thriving community."

The data were collected by personnel from Penn State, the U.S. Geological Survey, and volunteers. This course is offered through the SERC platform, in partnership with CUAHSI HydroClient\nIn this course, students will first investigate a low methane concentration measured in Southwest PA in Washington County. Students will find the analyses for samples in this area in HydroClient, then you will look up nearby well locations and records using the PA Oil and Gas Mapping Tool and the Exploration and Development Web Information Network (EDWIN), respectively, to begin to assess whether any of the streams may be contaminated by gas or oil wells.
