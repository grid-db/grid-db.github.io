We are actively inputting data into the Global RIver-lanD (GRID) Database. We have input published data, new data, online data, and unpublished data. We seek datasets from community groups, researchers, government agencies, industry, and river commissions. If you would like to submit a database or begin working with us, please consider reaching out to the [Mangement Team](/people/people.qmd)
